    "1 Mechanics in Non-inertial Reference Frames 1.1 Acceleration Without Rotation Consider an inertial reference frame (i.e not accelerating) which will be denoted S0, and a acceler- ating reference frame, S that has an acceleration of A. Note 1. Capital Letters refer to the accelerating reference frame S while lowercase letters refer to the inertial reference frame S0 Picture a moving reference frame, S, moving relative to S0. Imagine in the the moving reference frame that a ball with mass, m is being thrown. In order to consider the motion of the ball, the motion must be \ufb01rst considered in the inertial reference frame. F = m \u00a8r0  Where r0 is the ball\u2019s position relative to S0. Now, by considering the motion of the ball in the accelerating frame, the ball position relative to S is R. (It\u2019s velocity is \u02d9R. Thus, relating R to r0, we have: \u02d9r0 = \u02d9R + V  Newton\u2019s second law for the inertial reference frame by di\ufb00erentiate and multiplying by mass is: Finertial = \u2212mA = \u2212m \u00a8R 1.2 The Tides The Tidal Force Where: Ftide = \u2212GMmm( \u02c6d d2 \u2212 \u02c6d0 d2 0   ) G = Gravitational Constant d = Object\u2019s Position Relative to Moon d0 = Earth\u2019s Center Relative to the moon Mm = Mass of the moon 1.3 The Angular Velocity Vector The rest of the notes and the chapter will over reference frames that are rotating with respect to the inertial reference frame, so angular velocity has to be used. De\ufb01nition 1. Euler\u2019s Theorem - The most general motion of any body relative to a \ufb01xed point O is a rotation about some axis through O To specify this rotation about a given point O, we only have to give the direction of the axis and the rate of rotation, or angular velocity \u03c9. Because this has a magnitude and direction, it is an obvious choice to write this rotation vector as \u03c9, the angular velocity vector. That is: Where u is the unit vector \u03c9 = \u03c9u Vector Velocity The velocity at any point, P (position, r ) is given by: v = \u03c9 x r   Addition of Angular Velocities One can add angular velocities just like linear velocities. If body 3 is rotating at angular velocity \u03c932 relative to frame 2, and frame 2 is rotating at angular velocity \u03c921 relative to frame 1, then body 3 is rotating relative to frame 1 at angular velocity: \u03c931 = \u03c932 + \u03c921  1.4 Time Derivatives in Rotating Frames If frame S has a angular velocity, \u2126 relative to S0 then the time derivative of a single vector Q as seen in the two frames are related by: ( dQ dt )S0 = ( dQ dt )S + \u2126 x Q 1.5 Netwon\u2019s Second Law in a Rotating Frame A particle in an inertial reference frame, S0 obeys Newton\u2019s second law as we are use to: m d2r dt2 = F   Using the results from equation 8, the time derivative for a rotating frame with reference to an inertial frame can be given by: ( dr dt dr dt )S0 = ( )s + \u2126 x r  By di\ufb00erentiation, Newton\u2019s second law becomes: m\u00a8r = F + 2m \u02d9r x \u2126 + m(\u2126 x r) x \u2126  Where F is the sum of all forces in the inertial reference frame. 1.6 The Centrifugal Force This is an inertial force in a rotating reference frame Fcf = m(\u2126 x r) x \u2126 Free-Fall Acceleration (Non-Vertical Gravity) The acceleration due to the Centrifugal force is simply Fe\ufb00 = Fgrav + Fcf = mg0 + m\u21262R sin(\u03b8)\u02c6\u03c1 g = g0 + \u21262R sin(\u03b8)\u02c6\u03c1 grad = g0 \u2212 \u21262R sin2(\u03b8) gtan = \u21262R sin(\u03b8) cos(\u03b8) The angle between g and its radial direction is: \u03b1 \u2248 gtan grad \u03b1max = \u21262R 2g0 The maxium value at (\u03b8 = 45): 1.7 Coriolis Force      The Coriolis Force is another inertial force in a rotating reference frame that an object experiences when it is moving.
